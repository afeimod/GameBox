/**
 * Precise frame pacer for the emulation threads.
 *
 * Replaces the former `Thread.sleep(remaining)` pacing block that every
 * engine duplicated. The old pattern suffered from two problems:
 *
 *  1. **Sleep overshoot**: `Thread.sleep` on Android/Linux has a scheduler
 *     granularity of roughly 1-4 ms (sometimes much worse under load). With a
 *     16.6 ms budget at 60 fps, overshooting by even 2 ms means dropping below
 *     the target rate — the visible symptom was intermittent micro-stutter,
 *     especially noticeable on NDS where each frame's CPU cost is already high.
 *  2. **No fast-forward support in some engines** (NdsEngine / PsxEngine /
 *     DosEngine): their loops hardcoded a `1_000_000_000L / 60` sleep and
 *     ignored the requested fast-forward multiplier entirely — native-side
 *     "frame skip" only skipped the render/blit step, so fast-forward appeared
 *     completely broken on those platforms.
 *
 * How it works (hybrid precision strategy):
 *  - While more than ~2 ms remain until the deadline: [Thread.sleep] — cheap,
 *    fully interruptible, frees the CPU for other cores.
 *  - In the final sub-2 ms window: [LockSupport.parkNanos] — nanosecond-
 *    resolution waiting without scheduler wake granularity; wakes early on
 *    interrupt.
 *
 * This mirrors what the official melonDS Android frontend does with its
 * FrameTimer: the emulation thread targets an exact wall-clock deadline per
 * frame instead of "sleep remaining ms", and during fast-forward it simply
 * uses a divided deadline (or none at all) so emulation runs unthrottled.
