/*
 * Host interface for running a MIDlet's UI surface.
 *
 * Decouples the J2ME runtime (MidletThread, Display, ContextHolder) from the
 * concrete Activity that owns the rendering container. MicroActivity
 * implements this for the standalone J2ME-Loader path; an embedded host
 * driven by EmulatorScreen / J2meEngine can implement it without being an
 * Activity and without killing the process on exit.
 *
 * This is the first step of re-integrating J2ME into the unified
 * EmulatorScreen: until ContextHolder/MidletThread depend on this interface
 * instead of the concrete MicroActivity, a MIDlet cannot be driven by any
 * non-Activity host (MidletThread.resumeApp() requires
 * ContextHolder.getActivity() to return a visible MicroActivity, and
 * notifyDestroyed() calls finish() + Process.killProcess).
